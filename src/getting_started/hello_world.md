# Hello, World!

To write program that display string "Hello, world!" is traditional learning way first time touch new language.
Let's write the program in the Stack!

enter command `stack` on the your shell to start up the REPL of Stack.
If REPL is started, enter below code on the REPL and push enter-key twice.

```stack
(Hello, world!) print
```
If the code isn't wrong, Maybe it's output log like below.

```shell
Stack〔  〕 ←  (Hello, world!)
Stack〔 (Hello, world!) 〕 ←  print
[Output]: Hello, world!
Stack〔  〕
```
