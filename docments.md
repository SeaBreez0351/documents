# Stack programming language documentation

Stack programming language is a stack-based programming language and has its own characteristics and syntax.
This language combines simplicity and flexibility and is designed to handle a variety of programming tasks.

- Stack-based: All data used during program execution is stored and manipulated on the stack.
- Metaprogramming: Programs can be expressed as strings and dynamically generated at runtime.
- Flexibility: Various processes can be expressed concisely by combining commands and data types.

This document covers a wide range of Stack programming language concepts, from basic concepts to advanced features and metaprogramming techniques.
We aim to be a guide for a wide range of users, from beginners to advanced users, to effectively learn and utilize the Stack language.

## Who is Stack for?
The Stack programming language is designed to address a wide range of programming needs, but is particularly useful for people who:

### Learner
Choosing Stack as a new language to learn programming basics will help you understand stack-based approaches and metaprogramming concepts.
The language's simple syntax and flexibility make it easy for beginners to understand the basics of programming.

### Programmer
  
Stack is flexible and provides a concise representation of code, making it useful for efficient development in existing projects.
In addition, you can use metaprogramming functions to perform dynamic program generation and automation.

### Data Scientist

If you need to quickly create scripts for data processing and analysis, Stack is an effective tool for such tasks.
By stacking data and processing it, processing such as data conversion and aggregation becomes easier.

### educator

The Stack programming language can be used as teaching materials and exercises to teach the basics of programming.
Understanding stack concepts and metaprogramming principles will help students gain a deeper understanding of programming.

  ### researcher

Stack provides flexibility and speed for prototyping and experimenting with new algorithms and data structures.
Quickly create and test short scripts and experimental code.

Due to its simple syntax and flexibility, the Stack programming language is expected to be widely used as a tool to meet various programming needs.

## install
To use the Stack programming language, you need to install a processing system in your local environment.
You can install the processing system from the URL below. Save it wherever you like.

## "Hello, World" program
Once installed, let's create a traditional "Hello, World" program in the Stack programming language.
Open a text editor and create a new file. Enter the following code into the file.

````
(Hello, World!)
print
````
Save the file with an appropriate name. For example, use the name `hello_world.stk`.
The Stack programming language source code file extension is `.stk`.

### 3. Execute the program

Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where you saved the program. Then run the program by typing the command below.

````
stack hello_world.stk
````
This will output the message "Hello, World!".

You have successfully created and executed the "Hello, World" program. Now you can join the ranks of genuine Stack programmers.
